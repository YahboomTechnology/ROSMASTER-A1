![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/ROSMASTER-A1/blob/main/Yahboom_ROSMASETR_A1.jpg)
# Introduction
Yahboom newly launched ROSMASTER A1 is an embodied intelligent robot car platform designed specifically for ROS education and artificial intelligence research. Built on an Ackerman steering chassis, ROSMASTER A1 accurately replicates the steering model of smart car. It integrates peripherals such as a 3D depth camera/2MP HD camera PZT (optional), T-miniPlus LiDAR, AI intelligent voice module, and multi-function ROS robot expansion board, providing the robot with stereoscopic vision comparable to the human eye and precise environmental perception. Users can choose Raspberry Pi 5, Jetson NANO 4GB, or Jetson ORIN NANO 8G as the main control board. Developed in the ROS2 HUMBLE environment, it innovatively employs a dual-model inference architecture, ensuring a clear division of labor between decision-making and execution. It seamlessly integrates visual, voice, and text information, enabling not only precise SLAM mapping and navigation, AI visual recognition, but also human-like interaction capabilities with free dialogue interruption and dynamic feedback reasoning, meeting the needs of diverse scenarios.
# Features
* High-quality hardware configuration enables precise perception:

Integrated with 3D depth camera (superior kit) and 200W HD camera PTZ (standard kit), T-MINI Plus LiDAR, and AI large model voice module. Combined with high-torque metal 520 motor, ROS expansion board, and large-capacity lithium battery, provide robots with powerfule and long-lasting movement capabilities, as well as the ability to accurately perceive the 3D world.

* Professional Ackerman motion platform:

Replicates the actual steering structure of intelligent vehicles, providing a highly reliable mobile chassis foundation for the research and verification of autonomous driving algorithms (such as path planning and tracking control).

* Cutting-edge AI core, intelligent interactive experience:

Innovative dual-model inference architecture separates decision-making and execution, ensuring clear logic and efficient operation. Deeply integrated with AI large model voice technology, it supports free conversation interruption, continuous questioning, and dynamic feedback.

* Flexible and open master control solution:

Seamlessly supports the most popular development platforms: Raspberry Pi 5-8GB, Jetson NANO 4GB, or Jetson ORIN NANO 8GB. Users can freely choose the most cost-effective solution and build the most familiar development environment based on the project's requirements for computing power and AI performance.

* Deeply developed with ROS2 for Interesting functions:

Developed with ROS2-HUMBLE, compatible with mainstream simulation and visualization tools like Gazebo and RViz. In addition to intelligent interaction, it supports SLAM mapping and navigation, intelligent obstacle avoidance, tracking cruise control, AI visual recognition, object tracking, and so on. Users can learn basics in the classroom or achieve advanced functions in research and maker projects, meeting diverse needs from beginners to innovative users.
